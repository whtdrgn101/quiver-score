      <h2>Score Tracking</h2>
      <p>Log every end, arrow by arrow, with support for World Archery, NFAA, and custom round formats. Whether you shoot a Vegas 300 indoors or a WA 1440 outdoors, QuiverScore handles the scoring rules automatically. Record arrow values including X-ring hits, track running totals per stage, and export your sessions as CSV or PDF.</p>

      <h2>Equipment & Sight Marks</h2>
      <p>Catalog your bows, arrows, sights, stabilizers, and other accessories in one place. Create setup profiles that link specific combinations of equipment together and log sight mark settings for each distance so you always know your numbers at the range.</p>

      <h2>Clubs & Tournaments</h2>
      <p>Create or join an archery club to connect with fellow archers. Club admins can organize tournaments with registration, leaderboards, and results. Manage members, track standings, and compete with archers across your club.</p>

      <h2>Coaching</h2>

      <h2>Analytics & Classifications</h2>
