      <h1>QuiverScore — Target Archery Score Tracker</h1>
      <p>Track every arrow, master every round. QuiverScore is the modern score tracking application built for target archers of all levels, from beginners to competitive shooters.</p>

      <h2>Score Tracking</h2>
      <p>Log every end, arrow by arrow, with support for all standard target archery rounds. Whether you shoot a Vegas 300 indoors or a WA 1440 outdoors, QuiverScore handles the scoring rules automatically. Record arrow values including X-ring hits, track running totals per stage, and complete sessions at your own pace. Review detailed breakdowns of each end after your session is finished.</p>

      <h2>Equipment Management</h2>
      <p>Catalog your bows, arrows, sights, stabilizers, and other accessories in one place. Create setup profiles that link specific combinations of equipment together so you always know exactly what gear you were using for each session. Track which equipment delivers your best results over time.</p>

      <h2>Progress Analytics</h2>
      <p>See personal bests and scoring trends at a glance from your dashboard. QuiverScore automatically tracks your highest scores for every round type, total arrows shot, and session history. Compare sessions side by side to analyze how changes in equipment or technique affect your performance.</p>

      <h2>Club Features</h2>
      <p>Create or join an archery club to connect with fellow archers. Club owners and admins can organize events, manage members, and view leaderboards that rank shooters across the club. Form teams within your club for team-based competitions and track standings throughout the season.</p>

      <h2>Share Your Scores</h2>
      <p>Generate shareable links for any completed session so coaches, friends, or fellow club members can view your detailed scorecard. Enable your public profile to showcase your shooting history, personal records, and recent sessions to anyone who visits your profile page.</p>

      <h2>Works on Any Device</h2>
      <p>QuiverScore is a progressive web application that works on phones, tablets, and desktops. Install it to your home screen for quick access at the range. Your data syncs automatically so you can start a session on your phone and review the results on your computer later.</p>
